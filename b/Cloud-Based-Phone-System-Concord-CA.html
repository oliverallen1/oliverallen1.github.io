In a previous article for Harvard Business Review (Breaking the Compromise In Between Performance and Service," November 2006), I related lessons from several companies that have utilized a series of strategies to modify customer habits.</p>
<p>VoIP is great in most events, a mistake numerous organisations make is including a VoIP telephone system with a really weak broadband connection. A conventional standard PBX is a physical, on-site switching system that carries out these central functions and hooks up to the general public switched telephone system (PSTN). 8x8's out-of-the-box cloud solutions change conventional on-premises PBX hardware and software-based systems with a flexible and scalable  Software as a Service (SaaS) option, including cloud business phone service, contact center solutions, and conferencing.</p>

The PBX has revamped the method organisations deal with calls, providing a substantial upgrade to previous constraints.</p>
