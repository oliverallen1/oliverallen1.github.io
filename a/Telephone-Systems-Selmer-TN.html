<p>VoIP phone service has been around for some time as companies and entrepreneurs change from telephone services that utilize PSTN (Public Changed Telephone Network) to a more advanced system. There is a big range of VoIP providers on the internet which provide SIP trunking (telephony services) for less expensive call rates than traditional telephone providers. The software and hardware is cost-effective, too, for VoIP phone systems.
