<p>Both of these options give organisations a way to arrange call centers and client service departments. PBXes come in a wide array, although most today are digital and utilize the Internet to send voice and video communications. This decentralized setup is called geographic redundancy and it is the reason that cloud systems have extremely percentages of downtime. Before the introduction of mobile and cordless innovation, every telephone call needed to take a trip over the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) - whether it was local or long-distance.</p>
